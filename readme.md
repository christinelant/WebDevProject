PROJECT URL: https://christinelant.github.io/WebDevProject/

Project for web development class (CS290) in which we were given creative freedom on a website so long as it included a carousel, ordered list, form and downloadable PDF.

I chose to make a subscription based product called catfood. Users can sign up for a subscription using the form, learn about the CEOs and receive a downloadable file with a recipe.
